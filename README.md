You want to [Build Fast, Earn Fast&trade;](https://agoric.com/develop/)? If you don't want to [install the dependencies on your workstation](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/before-using-agoric.html), **use the button below to start a new development environment:**

## Agoric Dapp Workflow

The workspace starts with 3 terminals:

 - Start Project
 - Start the Agoric VM
 - Deploy the Dapp

The Agoric VM and Dapp start and continue to run. In the **Start
Project** terminal, you can run commands such as `agoric open` to open
the wallet.
